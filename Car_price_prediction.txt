Problem statement -
Dataset features:
  car brand,year,sold price, present price,KMS Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission Type, owner
we need to train ML algoritm so that it can find pattern on the datasets.Once we put new info it can predict
what price that particular used car can be sold.

Work Flow:
1. car data collection
2. do data pre processing just because we wont train raw dataset.
3. divide that data into train & test data.
4. feed these train n test datasets into two different Linear & Lasso regression model.And judge which one is
   better by accuracy score n percentage error.
5. feed new data to Trained Linear & Lasso regression model so that it can predict at what price the car can be 
   sold.
